            <br />Timeline:
            <br />
            <br />(April 1, 1922) Alan Jay Perlis is into Jewish family in in
            Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
            <br />
            <br />(1933) Perlis enroles in the public, and prestigious, Taylor
            Allderdice High School.
            <br />
            <br />(1939) Perlis enteres Carnegie Institute of Technology.
            <br />
            <br />(December 20, 1942) Perlis graduates with honors in Chemistry
            from the Carnegie Institute of Technology.
            <br />
            <br />(December 22, 1942) Perlis signs up for the Aviation Cadet
            Meteorology Program of the US Army Air Force.
            <br />
            <br />(September 1943) Perlis becomes a 2nd lieutenant in the
            meteorology services.
            <br />
            <br />(September 1945) Perlis returns to civilian life and enrolls
            in the California Institute of Technology for graduate study in
            chemistry. Perlis quikly realizes that this is not his passion and
            switches to the study of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute
            of Technology (MIT).
            <br />
            <br />(1949-1950) Perlis carries out research on numerical analysis
            methods, under the supervision of Philip Franklin at MIT, which
            leads to the completion of his master thesis.
            <br />
            <br />(1951) Perlis spends year in the Ballistic Research Laboratory
            (BRL) at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, where he works on the
            computation of ballistics tables.
            <br />
            <br />(1952) Perlis joins the Statistical Laboratory at Purdue
            University. At Purdue Perlis begins the research that leads him to
            eminence. Perlis persuads Kossac (Activities leader) and the
            university administrators to purchase the Datatron 205.
            <br />
            <br />(1955) Perlis’ team begins the design of a “mathematical
            language compiler” for it, later named the IT language (for Internal
            Translator). IT was a “compiler" (a set of programs that
            automatically translate programs written in a notation similar to
            that of mathematics into machine code).
            <br />
            <br />(1956) Perlis leaves Purdue University to become an associate
            professor of mathematics and director of the computation centre at
            the Carnegie Institute of Technology (Carnegie Mellon University).
            At the Carnegie Institute of Technology, Perlis completes the first
            version of IT on an IBM 650 computer. (IT was adopted by many
            university computing installations as an alternative to Fortran,
            which was only available for much larger and more expensive
            computers. At the same time, IT hinted at a way towards a universal
            language.)
            <br />
            <br />(May 1958) Under Perlis' leadership, a small group of ACM
            representatives meet in Zurich with the German-Swiss group resulting
            in the definition of the International Algorithmic Language (IAL)
            and its publication as report in the Communications of the ACM. (IAL
            was renamed ALGOL and was widely discussed in forums like
            Communications of the ACM, resulting in a new definition called
            ALGOL-60)
            <br />
            <br />(1971) Perlis moves to Yale University as the Eugene Higgins
            Professor of Computer Science in their new Computer Science
            Department.
            <br />
            <br />(February 7, 1990) Alan Jay Perlis dies.
